# Brainfuck_Interpreter
Brainfuck interpreter written in c++.

# Usage

Compile the .cpp file or download the binary (for linux) then run the program as follows :

>**brainfuck [--help/-h]** in order to get instructions 

>**brainfuck [--console/-c] or just type brainfuck** in order to pull up a python-like interactive console.

# Interactive Console

The Console has three commands that will be accepted by the interpreter

and 

>**restart** which will set the values of all the cells back to 0
